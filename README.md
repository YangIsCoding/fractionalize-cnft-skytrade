## in the compressed-nfts file

Completed:

1. Created a Merkle tree
2. Created a collection
3. Minted the cNFT and inserted it into the Merkle tree
4. Queried the asset ID and retrieved RPC asset information based on the asset ID

## as for Fractionalize-cNFT-on-Solana file

Goals:

First We fetch the asset id from the 4th step, Then, I intend to use Bubblegum's delegate and verifying collections features to lock the cNFT within the smart contract. Then, I plan to mint a specific amount of SPL tokens. Finally, users can redeem the cNFT by using these SPL tokens.

states:

I tried to follow the goal for development, but due to too many obstacles and issues, I plan to revert to the previous version. Although this version can only handle traditional NFTs, I can focus on transforming it to support cNFTs.
